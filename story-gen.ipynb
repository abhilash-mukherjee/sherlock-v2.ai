      "2. Top-level key must be: \"characterList\" — an array of character objects.\n",

      "4. All character names must be unique strings. Use British English idiom and period-appropriate phrasing. No anachronisms.\n",

      "OUTPUT FORMAT (strict)\n",
      "Return valid JSON with top-level key `characterList` which is a list of objects. Each list item must be an object with a single key `character` whose value is an object containing these fields:\n",
      "\n",
      "- name (*) : string — full name (e.g., \"Sherlock Holmes\")\n",
      "- type (*) : string — one of the enums: \"MAIN\", \"SUPPORTING\", \"VICTIM\", \"ANTAGONIST\"\n",
      "- role : string — short role label (e.g., \"detective\", \"client\", \"constable\")\n",
      "- gender (*) : string\n",
      "- ageRange (*) : string — approximate (e.g., \"30-40\")\n",
      "- socialClass (*) : string — period-appropriate (e.g., \"upper-middle\", \"working-class\")\n",
      "- occupation (*) : string\n",
      "- physicalDescription (*) : string — concise but evocative, period-appropriate language\n",
      "- speechStyle (*) : string — brief descriptor (e.g., \"precise, clipped\", \"florid, theatrical\")\n",
      "- voiceAndAccentDescription (*) : string — approximate voice & accent (e.g., \"RP with slight Cockney lilt\")\n",
      "- personalityTraits (*) : array of strings — 3–6 succinct traits\n",
      "- backStory : string — **required** for characters with type \"MAIN\", \"VICTIM\" or \"ANTAGONIST\"\n",

      "- motivations : string — concise motive or driving force\n",
      "- details : string — any extra, plot-relevant specifics (kept brief)\n",
      "- relationshipMap : object — mapping of other character names (exact-match strings) to short relationship descriptors\n",
      "\n",
      "REQUIREMENTS & CONSTRAINTS\n",
      "- The characterList MUST include exactly two canonical constants:\n",
      "  - \"Sherlock Holmes\" (type: \"MAIN\", role: \"detective\")\n",
      "  - \"James Watson\" (type: \"MAIN\", role: \"companion/narrator\")\n",
      "  These two must be labelled exactly as above and must include required MAIN fields (including backStory and weaknessesAndTrauma).\n",
      "- The list must include one or more known supporting characters described by Mrs Hudson — Landlady; discreet, practical, quietly observant, Inspector Lestrade — Scotland Yard inspector; competent, conventional, occasionally respectful of Holmes, Mrs Morstan — client-type supporting figure (gentle, anxious), or similar period-appropriate client. You may also add new supporting characters as needed.\n",
      "- The list must contain at least 2 character(s) whose type is \"VICTIM\".\n",
      "- \n",
      "- \n",
      "- The list must contain at least one antagonist. antagonist details: A single, cunning individual with intimate ties to London's underworld — urbane, resourceful, and personally dangerous.\n",
      "  - antagonist relation with victim: no prior known relation — the connection is revealed only through investigation\n",
      "  - antagonist relation with sherlock: personal vendetta — a past slight or intellectual humiliation fuels the antagonist\n",
      "  - antagonist relation with watson: antagonist is indifferent to Watson — views him only as Holmes's companion\n",
      "- Maintain Period authenticity: no anachronisms; use British English idiom where applicable.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "ADDITIONAL BEHAVIORAL RULES FOR THE GENERATOR\n",
      "- Produce compact, precise values — avoid long essays inside any field. Aim for clarity and immediate utility to a story generator.\n",
      "- `relationshipMap` keys must exactly match the `name` values of other characters in the same `characterList`. Relationship values should be short phrases (for example: \"former employer\", \"sibling — estranged\", \"client of Watson\").\n",
      "- For any MAIN character include `weaknessesAndTrauma` as 2–4 brief items that can plausibly motivate behaviour and create vulnerability.\n",
      "- For each ANTAGONIST and VICTIM, include a `backStory` describing one plot-relevant past event (1–3 sentences).\n",
      "- Do not invent or output any additional template parameters beyond those listed above.\n",
      "- Keep the JSON parsable and neatly structured (no trailing commas, correct quoting).\n",
      "\n",
      "Tone & Style\n",
      "- Strictly Victorian flavour: ocular detail, class distinctions, period vocabulary where appropriate. Use British English spelling and idiom.\n",
      "- Be evocative but economical — each field should be short and usable as an input for downstream story-generation steps.\n",
