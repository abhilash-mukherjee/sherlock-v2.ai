      "STORY SUMMARY:\n",
      "{\n",
      "  \"shortStory\": \"The Adventure of the Hollow Cane\\n\\nIt was a raw morning of late autumn when the fog lay in strips across Baker Street and the lamps burned without pride in the day. Our fire made a cheerful barricade against the creeping damp, and Holmes, who had been in an abstracted humour, sat with his long fingers steepled and his gaze set upon the swirl of smoke from his pipe.\\n\\nMrs Hudson ushered in a gentleman whose florid face and heavy watch-chain were at odds with his nervous hands. He wore prosperity like a garment that had become suddenly too tight. In his polished cane and carefully chosen gloves there was the fastidiousness of the counting-house, but his eyes betrayed a fear he could not master.\\n\\n“You must protect me, Mr Holmes,” said he, and the chain was at once between his fingers, worried back and forth as though it might by friction grow into a chain-mail. “I am Percival Larch, of Larch & Co., river warehouses. A certain person, once—ah—in some degree of association with me upon the river, has turned vengeful. My premises have been troubled by tokens—an ace of spades cut out of black card, a fish-hook daubed with tar—low, savage hints. The man is Esmond Vale; he is a brooding, dangerous creature, and I am in terror of him.”\\n\\n“State nothing you are not prepared to prove, Mr Larch,” said Holmes, with a slight bend of the head. “The river breeds many names with long echoes, but the law requires more than an echo.”\\n\\n“I—I have sent Dr Watson here,” continued Larch, turning to me with an anxious civility, “a small restorative phial I was recommended—my nerves are much afflicted—begging his professional judgement. I posted it last evening.”\\n\\nAt that instant there came Mrs Hudson with a brown-paper parcel upon a salver. “For you, doctor,” said she. “It was left with the night post.”\\n\\nHolmes’s chemical table was cleared with a sweep of his hand. I confess that my curiosity was piqued by Mr Larch’s agitation, and I took my pen-knife to the string and paper. Within lay a violet glass phial, squat, with a dubiously phrased label extolling its virtues in a font far too cheerful for pharmacology. The cork was seated tightly and bound about with glazed paper.\\n\\n“I will take but the briefest sniff,” said I, and had already eased the cork when the world grew suddenly to a sharp point.\\n\\nA spring, concealed beneath the cork, flicked. I felt the prick like a wasp’s lancet in my thumb. There followed a cold creep up my arm, and my lips tingled as if I had stepped from a hot room into mid-winter. Before I could speak, Holmes’s grip was iron at my wrist and his handkerchief bit a ligature above the puncture.\\n\\n“Aconite,” he snapped, and I saw in his eye the flare I had come to recognise when the game changed from mere puzzle to a matter of flesh and blood. “Keep your head, Watson. Mrs Hudson—coffee, hot and sweet; and the brandy. Rub his hands. There—walk, my dear fellow—walk, and we shall beat the cold that creeps.”\\n\\nMr Larch had gone from florid to grey. “Vale!” he whispered, his fingers fastened upon his chain so tightly that the gold bit him. “Vale!”\\n\\n“Pray do not borrow a man’s name until you have paid your own account,” said Holmes, between the knots of the handkerchief. “You are better already, Watson.”\\n\\nIn a quarter of an hour the stupor receded. The tingling remained, but the worst of that treacherous numbing was stayed. I confess that the thought of my pulse slowing upon a London morning at a fool’s contraption roused a cold anger. Holmes’s face, though composed, had a pale seam of wrath upon it which boded ill for the contriver of the toy.\\n\\nMr Larch, however, had no time for our recovery. He sprang to his feet with an exclamation and made for the vestibule. “I must away—I am much shaken—my cane—” His voice rose at the last word to a cry. “My cane! It is gone!”\\n\\nHolmes and I followed him down. In the umbrella-stand there stood a stick which at a glance resembled the handsome, banded cane he had carried. In the hand, however, it was heavier and ill-balanced. Holmes weighed it as a fencer might a foil, turned it, rapped its ferrule on the tiles, and ipecacuanha-like, the truth started from it in a whiff.\\n\\n“This is a crude imitation,” said he. “Observe, Watson, the rasp-marks at the base.” A small pen-knife flashed in his fingers and scraped the ferrule. Beneath, a rough plug in a hollow shaft, freshly rasped, showed its rawness. Holmes put the ferrule to his nostrils and winced. “Tar-pitch. Recent.” He wiped his fingers upon the mat, as one might rid oneself of a contagion.\\n\\n“My cane—my own cane—held private papers,” cried Larch, clasping his hands. “Mr Holmes, for pity’s sake—Vale carries a weighted cane—he watched my house—this is one of his.”\\n\\n“The word ‘private’ had a curious effect upon Holmes; there are particular adjectives that raise a man’s brows more effectively than any oath. He glanced at the stand, then back to our guest with a stillness that warned me he had seen more than he cared immediately to express. “We shall see to the matter,” said he, and led us back to the sitting-room.\\n\\nHolmes had spread upon his distorted map of London many strange spoils—ash, scarf, blood and bar of the city—but seldom had I seen him bend with more fastidious care than he did over that dangerous toy. He had swept the violet shards into a saucer and set the injured cork beneath the lens. He did not speak for a minute or two, and when he did it was with the chill precision which is his scalpel.\\n\\n“Your fob seal, Mr Larch, if you please.”\\n\\nOur visitor hesitated; then, as if obeying some older habit of deference to men of decision, he drew from his chain a heavy oval seal-fob. Holmes lifted it with a tip of the finger and set it upon the cork. The oval impression in the cork’s grain matched its contour as neatly as a signet meets the wax it has created.\\n\\n“The glass,” continued Holmes, as if Larch’s blustering protest that many merchants carry ovals were a gust not worth a closed window, “is cheap London chemist’s ware—violet-tinted. I recall, from certain notes at Scotland Yard, that a certain class of dockside artificer has a taste for bottles of a square, bluish cast, and a haughty disdain for broken glass that speaks. It is a morsel to be digested later.”\\n\\nHolmes is at his best when he is most military. He snapped into orders as a general might rattle into a deployment at the first rumour of the enemy.\\n\\n“Wiggins is not far,” said he, and indeed, a sharp-eyed lad of the Irregulars sold matches at the corner. “You will run to the nearest cab-rank, my lad, and learn if any gentleman left this door within the quarter-hour—note especially the watch-chain and the complexion. Take care who may overhear you.” A coin vanished in the boy’s fist even as he vanished into the fog.\\n\\n“Mrs Hudson, did any person call at the door whilst Mr Larch was with us?”\\n\\n“Why, yes, sir,” said she, and the neat mind behind her cap was plainly at work. “A quiet sort of clerk asked for ‘Dr Watson—urgent,’ he said. I told him the doctor was engaged and he went away without a word. He had a plain black coat, sir, and his hat brushed as if by a careful mother. Very mild.”\\n\\nHolmes’s eyes went to that distance where he speaks without moving his mouth. “Thank you, Mrs Hudson. You do me credit.”\\n\\nThough my thumb throbbed and my lips felt untrustworthy, I accompanied Holmes to the cab-rank at the end of Baker Street, for he would otherwise have gone without overcoat or breakfast. The drivers were stamping their feet around a brazier. Holmes inclined his head to one who had an intelligent ferret of a face; he, in turn, had the professional’s instant respect for a man who looked him cleanly in the eye and paid before he asked.\\n\\n“Yes, sir,” said the fellow, “I took a gent from your number not ten minutes after the clock, pale gentleman, very neat, with a ‘eavy gold chain. He came at a trot, he did, like money in the bank, and he says, ‘Threadneedle Street—sharp!’ and ‘sharp’ it was. We were at the corner by five past.”\\n\\nHolmes’s glance flicked to me and away. There was humour in the corners of his mouth, but he chose not to exercise it. “You do our city a service,” said he, and we left the driver richer by two shillings and a story for his mates.\\n\\nThe river at Wapping was a grey serpent coiling under a blanket of fog. There is a melancholy in those wharves—tarry odours, the clank of hoops, gulls crying like children—that appeals to the physician in me and the poet in Holmes, though neither sentiment was uppermost as we picked our way through Larch’s warehouses. A foreman with a scar that had an argument with a bottle looked away at our approach.\\n\\nHolmes went with his quiet certainty to the barrels where pitch was stored. He scraped delicately at the caulking, and from his pocket produced a fold of paper on which he had previously collected the flecks from the substitute cane’s ferrule. With a portable lens and a light borrowed from a cooper’s candle he compared the specks like a lapidary. “You see the red-lead grit?” he murmured. “Peculiar to this stock from Larch’s sheds, not river muck. The smear upon the ferrule is not an accident of a Wapping lane; it is a merchant’s own smear, transferred by intention.”\\n\\nAt the Prospect of Whitby we sought news as fishermen seek tides. Rumour flows in that snug corner as readily as ale. Here a docker swore that Esmond Vale had been seen upon Ratcliff Highway two nights past, his cane tapping like a metronome; there a man with the face of a disappointed clergyman laid down a black spade-pip upon the table, as if to hint that he himself stood in some dark stream where Vale went angling for easy men.\\n\\nHolmes listened, his face as void as a shuttered window. “Vale can open a lock with a hairpin,” a drinker confided. “His cane is not for walking, if you take me.”\\n\\nHolmes fingered the spade-pip casually, then pocketed it as a child might a marble. “Theatricality offends a mind like Vale’s,” he whispered to me as we stepped into the fog. “It attracts eyes. Note it, but do not wed it.”\\n\\nThat night at Baker Street the fog pressed its face to our panes and the violin lay across Holmes’s knees like a sleeping cat. He did not play. He stood, instead, and looked down upon the street, where the lamplighter had become a faint idea of a man and then vanished.\\n\\n“Consider, Watson,” said he at length, in the tone he reserves for the steps which are so plain they are overlooked, “a cheap violet phial, shattered for show; a cork impressed by our client’s own seal; a cane-switch within arm’s reach of his hand; tar that smells of his own sheds; and a cabman who speaks of a gold chain to Threadneedle Street at the bank’s opening. Esmond Vale, whom the Yard credits with square bluish flasks and noiseless contrivances, is painted in tar and violets for us—too readily. I suspect a thief invented to steal from a bankrupt conscience.”\\n\\n“You believe Larch took his own cane?” I asked, still recalling the cold creep of the aconite and the view of my own hand as if it were an object slightly removed from me.\\n\\n“I believe he sent for it,” said Holmes. “But we shall have the courtesy to prove what we suspect.”\\n\\nWe went next morning to Scotland Yard, those grey corridors echoing to the same boots that have walked down so many delusions and so many truths. Lestrade, buttoned in his greatcoat even at his desk, produced for us a thin file labelled “E. Vale,” in his neat, pointed hand.\\n\\n“Weighted cane, yes,” said he, with that official briskness which is his safeguard and his pride. “But he’s a quiet customer. Avoids noisy devices. His friends tell us he fancies square, bluish flacons—French, some say. Disdains aconite—‘too rustic,’ one of our informants notes. Prefers a chloretone mist that leaves no tale and little tremor. If he meant to mischief you, doctor, you would have gone to sleep without a fuss.” He glanced, not unkindly, at my bandaged thumb.\\n\\n“You’re telling me,” continued Lestrade, turning to Holmes with a thin smile, “that our merchant has been playing rough with stage properties, Mr Holmes?”\\n\\n“Roughly enough to leave his mark upon a cork,” returned Holmes.\\n\\nHolmes is a man of flour and yeast: give him a small leaven of fact and he will raise a true loaf for the table. He spent the midday in an errand which seemed trifling but was in fact exact.\\n\\nThe ace-of-spades pips and a sample fish-hook were taken by him to a Holborn stationer and a Bermondsey ironmonger he had long kept in mind. “Do you recall,” he asked each, “who bought these in bulk, three weeks past?” Both did. The stationer spoke of a well-fed clerk who paid with a Larch & Co. draft; the ironmonger of a man who “smelt of the river in his cuffs but of money in his pocket,” and who requested the hooks be daubed with tar “for a jest.” Holmes’s eyes sharpened at that.\\n\\nThat afternoon he wrote with delicate politeness to Mr Larch, inviting him to attend with all the tokens in his possession and to describe precisely his cane’s construction. He also asked Lestrade to oblige him; and he arranged that Mrs Hudson and the cabman be present behind the folding screen. “The stage is set,” said he, with that flicker at the corner of his mouth that is the nearest approach he makes to mirth.\\n\\nPercival Larch came, composed, but there were small beads at his temple which had not been there before. He had the air of a man who has dressed for a difficult dinner. Lestrade leaned with one hip against the mantel, his little notebook ready. I sat with my thumb discreetly swathed, though its pain had dropped to a reproach.\\n\\n“You were singularly unlucky, Mr Larch,” said Holmes amiably, “in that your attempted murder did not take, and your theft was observed by a cabman.”\\n\\n“Attempted murder?” blazed Larch. “I posted a restorative. The very idea—”\\n\\nHolmes set upon the table the cork from the phial and laid Mr Larch’s oval seal-fob beside it. He pressed the one to the other and the impressions mated as surely as husband answers wife. “We will not insult the cork with a coincidence,” said he, very quietly.\\n\\nHe took up the crude cane, rapped its ferrule, and with a twist of that long forefinger the rasped plug fell out like the tooth of a bad actor. From an envelope he produced two small packets of scrapings and poured them onto card. “Pitch from your barrel at Wapping; pitch from this ferrule. Under the lens the red-lead grit is identical, to its little crimson freckles.”\\n\\nThe folding screen stirred and Mrs Hudson stepped forward, her hands folded, her face as composed as if she announced that the muffin-man had called. “A clerk-like gentleman asked for Dr Watson while Mr Larch was upstairs,” said she. “He went away at once when he was told the doctor was engaged.” The cabman followed her. “I took this gentleman,” said he bluntly, with a gesture at Larch, “to Threadneedle Street, sharpish, not ten minutes after.”\\n\\nLestrade, with a small relish, produced two statements. “Holborn stationer; Bermondsey ironmonger. Larch & Co. drafts paid for spade-pips and hooks. Tar asked for and paid for.”\\n\\nLarch attempted one final feint. “Vale forced my hand!” he cried. “He would have killed me—he has the temper of a snake.”\\n\\n“You borrowed his reputation,” said Holmes, coldly. “You did not borrow his taste in glass.”\\n\\nHolmes’s method, when he chooses to display it, is like the unrolling of a chart upon which the reefs have been plainly marked in red ink all the time, only one has been blundering among them in a fog. He moved to the hearth and spoke as if he dictated to a clerk.\\n\\n“You posted the booby-trapped phial, impressed to your own seal, to set the trail towards Esmond Vale, knowing the Yard’s association of that name with such toys. You summoned a messenger—your own clerk, no doubt—to switch your cane in our vestibule while you sat with us, thinking yourself safe under our eyes. Then you yourself, sir, hastened by cab to Threadneedle Street, where you lodged your cane and the ledger within it in a strong-box before raising the cry of theft. You smeared the substitute ferrule with pitch from your own sheds to point us riverward. It is a subtlety that would have served, had you shown more art and less hurry.”\\n\\nPercival Larch sagged as if a string had been cut within him. His hands, deprived of their chain, hung foolishly at his sides. The pretence dropped like a mask that had grown too heavy to carry.\\n\\nHe confessed, with the abjectness of a man who sees that his invention has turned upon him. He had feared Vale’s vengeance—“the man keeps accounts not upon paper but upon his heart,” he said—and he had feared, too, the Customs men, who had of late grown inquisitive about his sheds. He had meant the phial to prick only, to cause an outcry that would be laid by city gossip at Vale’s door while his ledger slept in the bank beyond the reach of any sudden visit. He turned to me in a miserable humility. “Doctor, I beg your pardon,” said he, “I swear to you—death was never intended. A stir—no more.”\\n\\n“Sir,” said I, more stiffly than perhaps charity would recommend, “you gambled with a man’s heart for your convenience. There are wagers that cannot be redeemed.”\\n\\n“You have heard,” said Lestrade, pulling a folded paper from his inner pocket. “Here is a warrant. Mr Percival Larch, I arrest you for perverting the course of justice, for offences in contraband, and for the felonious assault upon Dr John Watson.”\\n\\nWith Mr Larch’s written instruction, the bank at Threadneedle Street surrendered the hollow cane and the secret ledger within it. It was a neat device: a screw-cap beneath what appeared a solid knob, the paper coiled as precisely as a flag about a staff. Holmes delivered the ledger to Lestrade with the solemnity of a clergyman passing a relic.\\n\\n“Figures are sometimes the bloodier evidence,” he observed. “They tell with more cruelty than testimony; they do not stammer.”\\n\\nEsmond Vale, hearing of the upset in his quiet affairs, slipped like an eel from any immediate grasp; but Yard watchers, Lestrade assured us, thereafter took a close interest in the languid gentleman with the weighted cane who, for all his taste, had been deprived of a convenient scapegoat.\\n\\nThe fog lifted two days later, and with it my head. Mrs Hudson, who had stoked fires and rubbed hands with the severity of a matron on a cold bath day, received from Mr Larch’s cell a stiff little note of apology, which she placed upon the mantel as if it were an account paid in full.\\n\\nHolmes tuned his violin and favoured me with a sober air, the sort of contemplative piece he keeps for evenings when London’s more sordid features have been laid bare. I thanked Mrs Hudson for her brisk ministrations and she, in turn, patted my sleeve and instructed me to keep to broth.\\n\\n“You observe, Watson,” said Holmes, lowering the bow after the last note had faded into the stair, “how a guilty conscience will often invent a thief to steal from it—and how the invention betrays the inventor.”\\n\\nI have often thought since that there is no device so perilous as the lie which seems, at its hatching, to sit easily upon the ledge of safety. Our city has many ledges and a great deal of fog between them. It is a mercy, sometimes, to have a friend who sees across. And as the last grey ribbon uncoiled from Baker Street that day, I reflected that if guilt was the most inventive of thieves, then truth, in Holmes’s hands, was the most exacting of constables.\"\n",

      "It was in the late autumn of that year that the fog lay in bands along Baker Street and the lamps burned as if ashamed to intervene between night and day. Our hearth held a resolute flame and we had barricaded ourselves against the creeping damp by every domestic art that Mrs Hudson’s thrift and my bachelor experience could supply. Holmes, in one of those vacant, abstracted humours which presaged either an outbreak of brilliant activity or a descent into the violin, sat with his long limbs drawn together and his steepled fingers making their accustomed buttress before his chin. His eyes were upon the wreath of smoke that drifted up from his pipe and flattened along the ceiling, and if an enemy had stolen upon him then, I believe some inner sentinel would have given the alarm before I could have stirred.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had taken up a medical monograph upon certain alkaloids which had lately been presented to the Society, and was finding more comfort in its precise, little sentences than I generally do in my profession’s efforts at style, when the bell pealed and there came Mrs Hudson’s foot, brisk and decisive, upon the stair.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A gentleman to see you, Mr Holmes,” said she, admitting a man whose presence seemed at first of a piece with the fog without, so little colour did his countenance show. He was florid by nature—the red of health rather than the purple of intemperance—and yet his cheeks had paled to that grey-fawn which indicates a heart driven too fast by fear. He wore prosperity, if I may say so, as one wears a garment that has been cut to measure for another and altered in haste; the heavy gold chain across his waistcoat, the gloss upon his hat, the polish of his boots—these were in order and yet not in ease. His hands, well kept and soft as a clerk’s, could not keep from worrying that chain as if by friction he might contrive a suit of mail.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You must protect me, Mr Holmes,” said he, and his voice had that urbane quality which speaks of the counting-house and the board-room. “I am Percival Larch, of Larch & Co., river warehouses. You may know the name.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have observed it painted in a large, ambitious hand upon certain sheds at Wapping,” returned Holmes, with the slightest bend of the head. “Pray be seated. The fog is mischievous when it catches a man who is nervous.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Larch sank into the chair upon our right, and being seated did not at once speak, but cast his eye across the room with the practised attention of a man who has been obliged to trust and is in consequence slow to do so. The corner where Holmes keeps certain reagents and curios led him to draw back a little, as if fearful that a stray acid might leap from its bottle at his cuff.\n",

      "“I am very much in fear,” said he at last. “My—ah—the position of my business and my own small standing alike depend upon my being left in quiet, and of late I am not left so. A certain person, once—ah—in some degree of association with me upon the river—has taken to menacing me. My premises have been troubled by tokens—an ace of spades cut out of black card, a fish-hook daubed with tar, and other low hints of the same kind—pasted to my office door, dropped on my very desk, placed where I cannot escape seeing them. The man is Esmond Vale. He is a brooding, dangerous creature, and I am in terror of him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Holmes raised one hand, lightly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“State nothing you are not prepared to prove, Mr Larch. The river breeds many names with long echoes, but the law requires more than an echo. You said, I think, ‘in some degree of association’?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Larch coloured.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am a merchant, Mr Holmes. The river is a good servant and a bad master. There are times when it is convenient to employ, through intermediaries, men who—” He spread his hands and glanced at me, as if requesting a firewall of charity between the facts of his trade and a doctor’s exact standards. “I hint rather than say, sir. The person in question made certain proposals to me two years past. I was at the time misled by the promise of profit; but—well—when trouble loomed, I drew back. I closed my sheds to certain consignments. The man took offence. Since then the tokens I have described have followed me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Holmes resumed his steepled posture and let his lids droop a fraction. When he speaks with that civility there is often a sting in the tail.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Esmond Vale,” said he. “Yes. The name has been mentioned at the Yard. Before we attach particulars to it, however, pray be exact in your own. These tokens—cut cards and hooks—what of more definite harm?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Larch hesitated, and for the first time he looked at me not as at a piece of furniture associated with Holmes, but as at a man who might, for all his modest manner, be of service.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have posted to Dr Watson here,” said he, inclining towards me, “a small restorative phial. I have been much troubled with palpitation and with a tremulousness of the hands, and my medical man, who is a simple practitioner at Stepney, said there was a preparation—valerians and such—remarkably soothing to the nerves. I received one by messenger yesterday—anonymous, it is true, but recommended—and I, being cautious by nature, thought I would seek Dr Watson’s opinion before setting it to my lips. I posted it last evening.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Before I could reply that no such parcel had reached me, there was a discreet knock and Mrs Hudson herself entered with a brown-paper packet upon a salver.\n",
      "\n",
      "“For you, doctor,” said she. “It was left with the night post.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Holmes’s eye, which had been dreamy, sharpened as it does when the prey breaks cover. He cleared his chemical table with one sweep—our unfortunate Persian slipper and a bundle of notes upon tobacco-ash slid together for once in amity—and motioned me to bring the parcel.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is not often that a physician’s curiosity becomes his enemy. I confess that mine was piqued by Mr Larch’s nervous manner and by the air of a stage property which clung to Ace of Spades and fish-hooks alike. I took my pen-knife to the string and paper, maintaining, I hope, that reasonable caution which experience has drilled into me, and laid bare a squat, violet-glass phial, labelled in a cheerful font that was wholly at odds with a scientific mind. The cork was seated tightly, and there was that around the neck which a chemist would call a binding of glazed paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I will take but the briefest sniff,” said I.\n",
      "\n",
      "Holmes sprang up.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Watson—!”\n",
      "\n",
      "I had already eased the cork from its collar when the world grew to a very sharp point. A spring, set beneath the cork, flicked with the treacherous life of a steel insect. I felt the prick like a wasp’s sting in my left thumb. There followed a creeping cold that began at the puncture and went up my arm as if a thin glove of ice had been drawn over it. My lips tingled as if I had stepped from a hot room into mid-winter; there was a moment when the hearth seemed very far away and the fog of the street very near.\n",
      "\n",
      "Holmes’s grip was upon my wrist before my mind had shaped a single oath. He had the handkerchief from his breast and had knotted it with a pull above the puncture, with that neatness which had once stopped my bleeding in a very different climate. He rubbed my hand vigorously from the fingers towards the ligature to expel what he could, and with his other hand thrust my hand into a basin of cold water in which he had dashed some spirit.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Aconite,” he snapped. “Keep your head, Watson. Mrs Hudson—coffee, hot and strong; and the brandy. Rub his hands—hard. Walk, my dear fellow. We shall beat the cold that creeps.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It is a peculiar humiliation to feel one’s own heart falter upon a London morning at the point of a fool’s contrivance. There came to me, absurdly enough, a recollection of the dry heat of an Afghan noon and of the way a man’s lips crack in that burning air; now they tingled as if frost-bitten. I obeyed Holmes as if upon parade, and he, with that rare tenderness of his which he hides beneath irony, stood by me, talking nonsense about an officer in an Indian regiment who had once tried to poison his cook, told with so much spirit and such a preposterous turn that I found myself laughing between the sips of brandy and the pain in my thumb.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Larch had fallen back into his chair and was gazing at me with a horror that was oddly mixed with calculation. He was like a man who watches a fire approach and is sorry for a human being and yet cannot help counting his own goods. When he saw that the colour was returning to my lips and that the dreadful creeping had been stayed above the ligature, he sprang up with an exclamation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I must away—I am much shaken—I—my cane—”\n",
      "\n",
      "His voice rose upon the last word to a sharp cry.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My cane! It is gone!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Holmes and I turned at once to the vestibule, for Mr Larch had run there like a man who sees his life run with it. In the umbrella-stand there were the usual debris of a bachelor’s winter life—my stout stick, Holmes’s ash-plant, an umbrella with a rib that had learned wisdom from misfortune—and a cane which at a glance resembled the handsome, banded article our visitor had carried in. But in the hand, this one was heavier and ill-balanced; even my inexperienced fingers felt it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Holmes weighed it delicately as a fencer might a foil. He rapped the ferrule smartly upon the tiles, and a faint, sickly exhalation came with the sound. He did not move his mouth, but a shadow of contempt flickered in his eye.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is a crude imitation,” said he. “Observe, Watson, the rasp-marks at the base.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He had his little pen-knife out in an instant, and with a turn and a pressure that made his long finger joints show white, he lifted the ferrule. Beneath was a rough plug in a hollow shaft. The rasped wood within was raw and showed no sheen of use. Holmes, with that uncanny delicacy which distinguishes a surgeon from a butcher, put the ferrule to his nostrils.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tar-pitch,” said he. “Recent. There is red-lead grit in it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He wiped his fingers upon the mat with that instinct of cleanliness which in him is as marked as his indifference to neatness in other matters.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My cane—my own cane—held private papers,” cried Larch, clasping his hands. “Mr Holmes, for pity’s sake—Vale carries a weighted cane—he watched my house—this is one of his.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The word ‘private’ is of an elasticity that gives me no comfort,” said Holmes, with a glance that went past the man and saw, as his glances often do, something upon the air that is not yet there. “We shall see to the matter. Be so good as to return to the sitting-room.”\n",
      "\n",
      "We went back. Holmes had swept the violet shards into a saucer and had set the treacherous cork under his lens. He did not speak for a full minute. When he did, it was with that chill precision which in him takes the place of heat.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your fob seal, Mr Larch, if you please.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Our visitor looked from one to the other with that peculiar expression which men wear when they stand upon a plank and feel it move under them. In the end, as if obeying an old deference to decisive natures, he drew from his chain a heavy oval seal-fob and handed it over.\n",
      "\n",
      "Holmes lifted it with the tip of one finger, as a chemist tongs a drop of acid, and set it upon the cork’s surface. He pressed, and then held both sideways to the light.\n",
      "\n",
      "The oval impressed in the cork’s grain was of the same contour, to a nicety, as the seal itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Many merchants carry ovals,” began Larch, in that airy tone with which a man is accustomed to ride down clerks and subordinates, and which sits ill when the ground is firm beneath his hearer’s feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The glass,” continued Holmes, as if the other had not spoken, “is cheap London chemist’s ware—violet-tinted. I recall, from certain notes at Scotland Yard, that a certain class of dockside artificer has a taste for bottles of a square, bluish cast, and a haughty disdain for anything that speaks too much when it breaks. You have, let me see, employed a cheap thing that announces itself, rather than a quiet contrivance.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He set the cork down and turned to Mrs Hudson, who had accomplished at once a splendid coffee and that nervous rubbing of my hands which sent a glow through my arm not unlike the sensation of life returning after frostbite.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mrs Hudson, did any person call at our door whilst Mr Larch was with us?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, yes, sir,” said she. “A quiet sort of gentleman—clerk-like—asked for Dr Watson, ‘urgent,’ he says. I told him the doctor was engaged and he went away without a word. He had a plain black coat and his hat brushed as if by a careful mother. Very mild.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thank you, Mrs Hudson. You do me credit.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Holmes can be military when necessity sharpens his pleasure in command. He stepped to the window, lifted the blind a little way, and made a small motion with his fingers. A sharp-eyed lad, who had the aspect of a match-seller and was, under that aspect, Captain of a band of as useful rascals as any army could desire, was at our door in a twinkling.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wiggins,” said Holmes, “you will run to the nearest cab-rank and learn if any gentleman left this door within the quarter-hour—note especially his chain and his complexion. Take care who may overhear you, and see without being seen.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Wiggins received a coin in such a way that I understood how his pockets never jangled, and vanished into the fog like a decent boy who had been to Sunday-school all his life.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My cane,” murmured Larch, as if self and property were for him interchangeable words. “It is a handsome piece, Mr Holmes; a Malacca with bands; the knob is—I regret that there are papers—”\n",
      "\n",
      "Holmes’s eye rested upon him for a second with that stillness which might discourage a more brazen soul than Mr Larch.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We shall recover what we can,” said he.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pray allow me to examine your hand, Watson.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I gave him my thumb. Under the ligature the flesh was blanched; above it, the palm was mottled where the cold had crept. The puncture itself was a minute speck no larger than the head of the finest pin. I confess that my first clinical interest had been swallowed up in the personal; I had felt the curious sinking and the alteration in my own pulse with the detached indignation of a man betrayed by his instruments. Holmes, for his part, seemed less concerned with my physiology than with the instrument which had wrought upon it.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had taken from his shelf a small book of tests and now, having prised from the inside of the cork a film upon which the spring had scraped as it shot, he subjected this to a series of reagents. I cannot answer for every precise reaction, but I saw the familiar precipitate of an alkaloid upon treatment with mercuric-potassium iodide, and the oily film that is often accompanying those of the aconite family. He glanced at me when one droplet took a faint, pale-blue tint upon addition of sulphuric acid in the presence of sugar—a delicate business upon which, as we all know, contradictions abound.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Alkaloid,” said he curtly. “Non-volatile. Watson, if you were coniine we should smell you, but we do not. The tingling is very characteristic; and—pardon—the flutter I feel here? Your heart is an honest one and returns to order with reproof. We shall keep you warm. Mrs Hudson, the foot-warmer.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was at that instant that the door opened and Wiggins was back, as invisible and yet as effective as the string that rings a church-bell.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A gent went off from here, sir, not ten minutes, with a chain fit to sink a ferry,” said he. “Pale, neat chap. Told the driver ‘Threadneedle Street—sharp!’ and pointed like a finger-post.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Holmes’s glance flicked over me.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Threadneedle Street,” he repeated. “The banks. Curious. We shall take a cab ourselves, Watson—no, no, my dear fellow; you will not be left. Bring your coat. We have an appointment with the air.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sir,” began Mr Larch, rising in agitation, “I cannot bear—my cane—my—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your cane will hardly sprout legs,” said Holmes with his dryest civility. “Pray remain or go, as you please. You shall hear from me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "We went down. The cool air without did me more good than all the brandy, for the fog had that clean taste which follows a night of dry frost. The drivers at the end of Baker Street were stamping their feet about a brazier. Holmes had a word for the intelligent-looking one who had served him before, and whom he had raised, by the judicious application of coins and candour, to that self-respect in which honesty thrives.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, sir,” said the fellow, his face twisting into a grin without losing its ferret-keenness. “I took a gent from your number not ten minutes after the hour, pale gentleman, very neat, with a ’eavy gold chain. He came at a trot, he did, like money in the bank, and he says, ‘Threadneedle Street—sharp!’ and sharp it were. We was at the corner by five past.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You do your city a service,” said Holmes, and gave him two shillings for telling the truth in good English.\n",
      "\n",
      "We did not then go to the City. Holmes’s instinct, which is not guesswork but experience compressed to speed, took him in the contrary direction. He signalled to another cab.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The river,” said he briskly. “Larch & Co.—Wapping.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As we drove, he took from his pocket a scrap of paper upon which he had, with his little glass, scraped the black pitch from the imitation cane’s ferrule.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The tar,” said he, “has red-lead grit in it. Not river mud. Some yards use it to temper their caulking. I shall be disappointed if we do not find its twin in Larch’s own stores.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You do not think,” said I, rubbing my hands until the blood returned in a more independent fashion, “that Vale—this Esmond Vale—has had a hand in this morning’s work?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Holmes’s lips twitched.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Esmond Vale is a name, and behind it a man, who distastes the noisy contrivance. He has a clean taste; he likes square, bluish flacons, French; and if he wished you injury, my dear fellow, you would have gone to sleep without the slightest complaint to posterity. Aconite is rustic. Theatricality offends such men. They do not paste ace-of-spades upon office-doors. They are the ace, if we must talk of that childish game.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then Mr Larch—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Has borrowed a reputation which he does not deserve. But let us be civil to our theory and grant it only so much as it can prove.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The journey to Wapping is under any circumstances a lesson in London’s multiplicity. We left the stucco respectability of Marylebone, pierced the commercial arteries of Holborn, skirted certain courts where ignorance was as thick as fog and vice as visible as the coster’s oranges, and came at last into that sad, tarry atmosphere which belongs to the river. The gulls cried without laughter and the ropes, drawn taut in the mirk, hummed like strings. From the water, where barges, with their red-brown sails furled, lay like sleeping beasts, came the clank of a chain and the distant, human cough of a lighterman. It is a place for the physician to reflect and the poet to be simple.\n",
      "\n",
      "Holmes pushed open the office door of Larch & Co. without so much as a tap. The clerk within, a young man with a patient face and a narrow forehead, rose.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr Larch is abroad,” said he. “Can I—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your pitch,” said Holmes, with that friendly brusqueness which wins confidences from men without status. “Where kept?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“At the rear,” returned the clerk, a little staggered but not offended. “May I ask—?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You may ask your employer later to tell you how near he came to being an accessory. We shall take a pinch of your property and restore you an insight. Come, Watson.”\n",
      "\n",
      "We emerged upon the sheds where barrels, marked with letters that had lost their precise meaning for the men who hoisted them, stood in files like soldiers who have forgotten their regiment. The pitch was in casks to the left. Holmes, with a delicate scraper, lifted a sample of their tar and placed it upon a piece of card. He took out the scrapings from the ferrule and laid them upon another. The cooper whose candle he borrowed came and looked on with the reverence which lower men have for a mysterious manipulation of small things.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Under the lens,” murmured Holmes, “you see the red grit? There—a little, flat, vermilion fragment. The same, to the very character of its fracture. I do not think the river’s mud contains such eloquence. Mr Larch’s sheds do. He has sign-posted us back to himself with a liberal hand.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The foreman, a man with a scar that had quarrelled with a bottle and lost, turned his face aside, which is to say he looked into his own experience and found no comfort there.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr Larch liked a handsome cane,” said he. “A hollow thing. A gentleman’s trifle.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hollow?” said Holmes, quietly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I saw him once with the knob off,” returned the man, suddenly aware that he had said too much and looking almost comical in his effort to swallow his words back down. “He told me I was a liar for seeing. No offence meant.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No offence taken,” said Holmes, and wrote the words “knob—screw-cap?” upon his cuff. He has ruined more linen with his pencil than any man in London, and yet his shirts are always immaculate enough to pass a colonel at inspection.\n",
      "\n",
      "We went thereafter to the Prospect of Whitby, not for mischief but for information. Rumour flows in that snug place as readily as beer, and Holmes has a knack of separating it from gossip as one separates cream from milk by a flick of the wrist.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Esmond Vale?” said a docker with a chest like a barrel and a tattoo of a mermaid who had known better days. “Aye, I’ve seen him, Mr Holmes. Walks light. Cane a-tap-tap like a metronome. Watches a man out of a face that doesn’t much trouble itself to change.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And his bottles?” asked Holmes, casually toying with a black spade-pip that had appeared upon the table with our ale—no doings of the landlord’s, who is a decent fellow. “Has our friend a taste for violet glass?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The docker laughed and made a sound which I will not commit to paper, though it was not without wit.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He’d use a blue coffin and sleep in it upright before he touched that cheap stuff,” said he. “He’s particular, Mr Holmes. French ware. Square, bluish flasks. You can see the clean edges like a gem.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bad customer,” remarked another, with the face of a disappointed clergyman and a mouth that had missed ordination by an inch. “Keeps an account at the bank of revenge. Writes nothing down. I seen him once take an ace—just so—and lay it down beside a man. But I wouldn’t say by this and that that he done your gentleman’s tricks.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Holmes fingered the spade-pip, then put it in his pocket with the air of a man who collects marbles. He is at such times so careless as to be the better of the two; by which I mean that his disdain of a clue is often of more value than another man’s pursuit.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Theatricality offends a mind like Vale’s,” he said in an undertone as we went out. “It attracts eyes. Note it, but do not wed it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "We dined that night at Baker Street not without a certain decency of appetite, for my adventures with aconite had ended, thanks to Holmes’s promptitude, with no more than a tingling in the thumb and a certain lassitude. Mrs Hudson would have had me abed and broth-fed like a child, but I bribed her with the assurance that I would not touch tobacco that night.\n",
      "\n",
      "Holmes did not play. He stood at the window and looked down upon the street where the lamplighter had long since ceased to be more than a notion of a man and gone away, and he watched that curious procession which goes on under the fog as under clear skies—clerks late from the City carrying their weak little brief-bags; a woman with a basket and a shawl who is a mother to her husband and a child to her children; a policeman who knows every cobble by its Christian name; and that steady stream of vehicles which is like blood in the arteries of London.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Consider, Watson,” said he at length, in that tone he reserves for the truths which are so plain that one overlooks them: “a cheap violet phial, shattered for show; a cork impressed by our client’s own seal; a cane-switch within arm’s reach of his hand; tar that smells of his own sheds; and a cabman who speaks of a gold chain upon a man who goes to Threadneedle Street at the bank’s opening. This Vale, whom the Yard credits with square bluish flacons and noiseless contrivances, is painted in our minds with tar and violets—too readily. There is an old observation of mine—that a guilty conscience often invents a thief to steal from it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You believe Larch took his own cane?” I asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I believe he sent for it,” said Holmes. “But we shall have the courtesy to prove what we suspect.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The courtesy of proof is dear to Holmes. We went next morning to Scotland Yard—the same grey corridors echoing with the same boots that have walked down so many delusions and so many truths. Lestrade received us with that air of official briskness which is both his armour and his charm. He is a useful fellow, for all his jealousy of Holmes’s quickness, and I have come to respect him as one respects a man who, in his own groove, is honest.\n",
      "\n",
      "“E. Vale,” said he, after a trim little bow to me and a glance at my bandaged thumb which was not without human feeling. He produced a file no thicker than one of my medical notebooks and laid it upon the table. “Weighted cane, yes. Keeps his right hand in training by swinging it as if it were a part of him. But—” and here he looked at Holmes almost mischievously, as if to meet him upon the half—that subtlety which is the highest flattery a Yard man can pay—“he’s a quiet customer. Avoids noisy devices. His friends tell us he fancies square, bluish flacons—French, some say. Disdains aconite—‘too rustic,’ is the phrase I have noted. Prefers a chloretone mist. If he meant to mischief you, doctor, you would have gone to sleep without a fuss.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your kindness does you credit,” said I, a trifle dryly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are telling me,” continued Lestrade, turning to Holmes with a little flourish of his pencil, “that our merchant has been playing rough with stage properties, Mr Holmes?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Roughly enough to leave his mark upon a cork,” returned Holmes.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are times when a small errand is a key. Holmes spent the late morning upon two such trivialities which, to a man less careful, might have seemed unworthy of his attention and were in fact of capital importance. We drove first to a Holborn stationer whom Holmes had long kept in mind by that singular memory of his which is like a set of drawers each labelled to absurdity. The fellow knew us and was more at ease when Holmes asked a question than when a policeman does.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you recall,” said Holmes, laying upon the counter a little ace-of-spades cut from black card which we had obtained at the Prospect of Whitby, “who bought these in bulk three weeks past? The cut is rough; the card is of your third grade; the paste used has a ragged edge.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The stationer smiled with a craftsman’s pride.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah, Mr Holmes—if only the law would notice that a bad paste cannot hold a lie,” said he. “Yes. A well-fed clerk bought a hundred of ’em. Paid with a draft—Larch & Co. I call that an honest card, sir. Stands to be counted.”\n",
      "\n",
      "We went then to Bermondsey, to a little ironmonger’s that had a long coquetry with rust and a clean mind, and Holmes, with no more fuss than a lady buying pins, asked after fish-hooks daubed with tar.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sold six dozen,” said the ironmonger, the corners of his mouth twitching as if some inward humour tickled him. “Three weeks ago. To a gentleman who smelt of the river in his cuffs and of money in his pocket. ‘Daub them with tar,’ says he, ‘for a jest,’ and I says, ‘The river supplies your tar free, sir,’ and he says, plain as print, ‘It must be a particular tar.’ Paid with a Larch & Co. draft. I know a signature as I know my own nose.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Holmes’s eyes sharpened and, when he is pleased, they soften by a degree not visible to any but a friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You have my thanks,” said he. “You will please remember that the law is sometimes grateful for exact tradesmen.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He wrote that afternoon with the stiffest politeness to Mr Larch and desired him to attend at Baker Street with all the tokens he had received and with an exact description of his cane’s construction. He sent also to Lestrade, asking that he oblige him with his presence. It amused me to see Holmes set his stage. He placed our folding screen to one side of the hearth; behind it he stationed Mrs Hudson and the cabman who had carried Larch to Threadneedle Street, with instruction to step forth at a sign. Wiggins, too, was enlisted to loiter innocently upon the corner with an eye for any clerk-like person who might think of repeating his performance. When all was arranged, Holmes stood in the middle of the room with his hands behind him, and that little prosaic smile appeared at the corner of his mouth which is his nearest approach to mirth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Percival Larch came at the appointed hour. He had dressed as men do who go into the City to smooth a matter—hat more brushed than usual, neck-cloth chosen with care, and a knot tied twice to conceal a tremor. He carried a packet of tokens—cards, hooks, and two little paper-wrapped offerings which he said had been found upon his desk, one purporting to be a salve, the other a sachet. There was a little moisture at his shaved temple which had not been there before. Lestrade, buttoned in his greatcoat to the last button as if to demonstrate that the law feels no weather, leaned with one hip against the mantel and had his notebook ready. I sat with my thumb discreetly swathed, though it now did little more than reproach me when I forgot myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You were singularly unlucky, Mr Larch,” said Holmes amiably, “in that your attempted murder did not take, and your theft was observed by a cabman.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Attempted murder?” The word leaped out of Larch like a fish from a net. “I posted a restorative. The very idea—”\n",
      "\n",
      "Holmes set upon the table the cork from the violet phial and laid Mr Larch’s oval seal-fob beside it. He pressed the one to the other and held them up.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The impression mates,” said he, “as surely as husband answers wife. We will not insult the cork with a coincidence.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Larch made a small, ungoverned motion of the hand and controlled it again. He laughed—too quickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Many men possess ovals,” said he.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is fortunate,” returned Holmes, “that we need not rely upon ovals. Permit me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He took up the crude cane, rapped its ferrule, and with that turn of his finger which, in another life, would have made him a marvellous safe-breaker and might, in this, put the fear of God into all such gentry, he dislodged the rasped plug. The thing fell out like the tooth of a bad actor. From an envelope in his pocket he poured upon card two little piles of black scrapings.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pitch from your barrel at Wapping,” said he, indicating the one; “pitch from the ferrule. Under the lens”—he laid the glass upon one—“the red-lead grit is identical, to its little crimson freckles. Your ironmonger will tell you that a grit has a character; so do you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a small stir behind the screen. Holmes’s forefinger, which looks when it points as if it could draw blood by tapping, moved a hair. Mrs Hudson came forward with that composure which would enable her to announce calmly that a whale had called at the back door.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A clerk-like gentleman asked for Dr Watson while Mr Larch was upstairs,” said she. “He went away at once when told the doctor was engaged.” She folded her hands upon her apron and looked across to me with an affection I cannot describe but which warmed me more than the brandy had.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cabman followed her with the bluntness of his class.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I took this gentleman,” said he, with a gesture at Larch that was almost affectionate in its contempt, “to Threadneedle Street, sharpish, not ten minutes after his business ’ere. He says ‘Sharp,’ and sharp I am.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Lestrade, with that relish which even the most decorous of us cannot entirely hide when a colleague is about to fall in, produced two folded papers and held them between finger and thumb as a conjurer produces a coin.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Holborn stationer,” said he. “Bermondsey ironmonger. Larch & Co. drafts for spade-pips and hooks. Tar asked for and paid for. ‘For a jest.’” He could not refrain from making the quotation with a little irony.\n",
      "\n",
      "Larch looked about him like a man who, on a deck that he thought firm, feels the tilt and hears the wash of water where it should not be. He took a step as if to make for the door, then checked himself. Guilt is often far less brave than honour, but it will play feints like any swordsman.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Vale forced my hand!” he cried, his voice rising. “He would have killed me—he has the temper of a snake. The man broods. He saw that I—that my premises—had to be closed against certain consignments. He—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You borrowed his reputation,” said Holmes, very coldly. “You did not borrow his taste in glass.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Holmes has a way, when he chooses, of making his method visible as if one watched a man unroll a chart upon which reefs which have always been there are marked with a red cross. He walked to the hearth and spoke in that tone with which he dictates to a clerk.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You posted the booby-trapped phial, impressed with your own seal, to set the trail towards Esmond Vale, knowing the Yard’s association of that name with clever toys. The taste betrays you. You summoned a messenger—your own clerk, to judge by Mrs Hudson’s description—to switch your cane in our vestibule whilst you sat with us, thinking yourself safe under our eyes. Then you yourself, sir, hastened by cab to Threadneedle Street, where you lodged your cane and the ledger within it in a strong-box before raising the cry of theft. You smeared the substitute ferrule with pitch from your own sheds to point us riverward. You ensured the presence of ace-of-spades and fish-hooks bought with your own drafts, and asked that the hooks be daubed with tar—‘for a jest’—to make a picturesque tale for those who prefer pictures to facts. It would have served, had you shown more art and less hurry.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Percival Larch sagged as if a string had been cut within him. He made a movement with his hand as if to seek the chain which had been his comfort and found it absurd when his fingers closed upon it. He looked at me and his florid face took on that pallid humility which is uglier in a well-fed man than hunger.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I confess,” said he, in a tone of a man who has at last found that the lie will not be borne. “I confess. I feared Vale—and I fear him still; the man keeps accounts not upon paper but upon his heart. I feared the Customs men; they have of late grown inquisitive about my sheds. I have had dealings—a man must live—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” said Holmes, sharply. “A man must live with himself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Larch swallowed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I meant the phial to prick only, to cause an outcry that would be laid by city gossip at Vale’s door whilst my ledger slept in the bank beyond reach of an officer’s sudden visit. I swear to you, Doctor—I beg your pardon—I swear to you—death was never intended—only a stir—only—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sir,” said I, taking what I fear was some sternness from the memory of a creeping cold up my arm, “you gambled with a man’s heart for your convenience. There are wagers that cannot be redeemed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Lestrade straightened, which in him is a ceremony, and took from his breast a paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You have heard,” said he. “Here is a warrant. Mr Percival Larch, I arrest you for perverting the course of justice; for offences in contraband to be named upon examination; and for the felonious assault upon Dr John Watson. You will accompany me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a movement, a sombre gratitude, upon Larch’s face, as if the hand of the law delivered him from a worse hand that waited along the wharf. I have seen that look on men who prefer a clean rope to a slow fever.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr Holmes,” said he, “if I sign an instruction that the bank yield the cane and the papers, will you—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We will accompany Lestrade,” returned Holmes. “Your compliance will be noted.”\n",
      "\n",
      "We went then into the City, to a building whose elegance lies in the fact that it seems to be ashamed of itself. The manager received us with that urbane blankness which bankers cultivate and which is the only wall against many assaults. Upon the production of Larch’s written instruction, sealed with the oval seal which had in a little earlier chapter been his betrayal, and under Lestrade’s warrant, the strong-box was opened. The cane lay within—handsome Malacca, banded, innocent to the eye as any gentleman’s toy. Holmes, with a glance at the manager which, if translated into words, would have said, “Permit me to be a little impertinent in your house for the sake of the law,” took it into his own hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "He examined the knob with minute attention. It was as if a jeweller looked at a pearl and saw a hinge. He turned, and the knob yielded—screwed, not pressed, with a thread so fine that it would have baffled a less delicate touch. Within was a hollow shaft wherein lay, coiled as neatly as a flag about a staff, a paper—long, thin, columns of figures upon it that had a clean cruelty which human testimony does not match.\n",
      "\n",
      "Holmes drew it forth and rolled it backwards upon the table to let it spring flat. Lestrade bent over it, and his lean face, which is generally an expression of official anonymity, sharpened with interest.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Figures are sometimes the bloodier evidence,” observed Holmes quietly. “They tell with more cruelty than speech; they do not stammer.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The ledger was what Lestrade desired—dates, consignments, names of smacks that had slipped past the eyes of Customs under nights when fog had been a partner, sums paid in coin and kind; and here, not written in full but by a cipher that Holmes glanced at and dismissed as the sort that a merchant forms without the wit to hide it from a school-boy, was a notation which married the initial E to certain payments. If Esmond Vale was careful not to write, men had written of him all the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Vale will be useful to me yet,” said Lestrade, closing the roll with a tight little hand. “For the present”—and here he bowed to Holmes with a dignity that does him honour—“I shall say that the Office has been anticipated in the most agreeable way.”\n",
      "\n",
      "We came away from the bank and the clean cruelty of figures to a street where men and women were occupied in many small and noisy cruelties and kindnesses—the selling of things which can be done without and the buying of things which cannot, and that astonishing briskness of step which the City imposes upon men whether or not they have anything to hurry for. When we had climbed the stairs to Baker Street, Holmes flung himself into his chair with that long out-breath which is his only indulgence in fatigue.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You see, Watson,” said he. “The thief we are asked to pursue is often a man’s own conscience in a mask. If he had been less ready to believe in his own fictions he might have been more successful.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You will have made an enemy in Esmond Vale,” I remarked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Vale will ignore me so long as I am useful to him,” returned Holmes. “And I am always useful.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It is one of the minor irritations of a case that the epilogue is apt to be longer than the drama. Lestrade made, as we had expected, a sane use of the ledger. The Customs officers, whom Mr Larch had been pleased to despise, turned out to have more brains in their round heads than he had allowed. They moved upon certain sheds and certain men with a quietness which would have pleased Esmond Vale himself. Vale, hearing of the upset in his affairs, slid like an eel from immediate grasp and went on with his calm eyes and his cane that tapped like a metronome. But the watchers of the Yard, Lestrade assured us, thereafter took a close interest in the languid gentleman who, for all his taste, had been deprived of a convenient scapegoat.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for Mr Larch, his apology to Mrs Hudson came from his cell in the form of a stiff little note with all the emotion pressed out of it by a lawyer’s forefinger. She placed it upon the mantel as if it were an account paid in full, and thereafter spoke of him not at all, which is her way of describing a man’s character.\n",
      "\n",
      "My thumb healed with no more consequence than a slight numbness which went away with time. I am ashamed to confess that, when I went to dress the little wound upon the second day, I felt again that creep and that sudden broadening of the world which had accompanied the first moment, and was angry with myself for my own theatre. The mind carries more ghosts than any house could show. Holmes was gentler with me than I deserved.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You will not take it as a reproach,” said he, “if I say that you sometimes open a parcel as if life were a picnic. You are saved from folly by courage.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I took in the rebuke its tincture of affection and thanked him the more for the tincture.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had our fire high and the blind down against a rain which had washed away the fog and left the city as if it had been taken to pieces and put together again. Upon the table lay a little square, bluish bottle which Lestrade had sent to Holmes with the laconic line: “Vale’s taste.” Holmes had set it there that his eye might meet it when it was inclined to be lazy and remember that the world contains a man who is almost as pleasant as an intellectual problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "He tuned his violin and, with that exquisite touch of his, played me a sober air. It is a habit of his when London has been very much itself and he has been permitted to be more than himself for a time. The notes dropped like beads upon the string and slipped into the air with a melancholy that was never depressing. I sat with my hands upon my knees and watched the light make patterns upon the hearth-rug through the grille.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a while Holmes lowered the bow and stood with it in his hand, looking, not at me, but at that place upon the wall where the portrait of our late adversary, the professor, once had hung before I forbade it the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You observe, Watson,” said he, “how a guilty conscience will often invent a thief to steal from it—and how the invention betrays the inventor.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” said I. “And I have observed also that London is a generous accomplice to such inventions. It supplies fogs.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Fogs,” said he, and there was the ghost of a smile and then the violin bow moved once more. “And men.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It has often occurred to me, since that day, that there is no device so perilous as the lie which seems, at its hatching, to sit easily upon the ledge of safety. Our city has many ledges and a great deal of fog between them. It is a mercy that a man may sometimes have a friend who sees across. When the last grey ribbon uncoiled from Baker Street and the rain made small, lucid patterns upon the window, I thought of that little cold bite in my thumb and of the warm grip which had followed it; and I reflected that if guilt was the most inventive of thieves, then truth, in the hands of Sherlock Holmes, was the most exacting of constables.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a small postscript to this affair which illustrates more clearly than I could in any moral the way in which Holmes’s mind never leaves a case until its roots have been entirely devoured. Some days later there came to us an honest fellow from Wapping, whom I recognised as the cooper who had lent us a candle. He brought in his hand a cane—not Larch’s, which had gone with its ledger where such things go, but a cheap copy—Malacca varnished to look like the real thing, with bands too bright by a shade.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I found this in a lane by our sheds, sirs,” said he. “I thought as you might make more of it than me. There’s a weight to it not just in the head.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Holmes took it, balanced it, and smiled as a dog might show its teeth without offence.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The underworld borrows fashions as quickly as it borrows money,” said he. He rapped the ferrule and the same tarry whiff came forth. “Vale’s men—if they be his—have their wits about them. But they do not know how to rasp without leaving shavings.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He held up a little curl of wood between finger and thumb like a trinket.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tell Lestrade,” said he to me, “that he may look for certain petty thefts committed within a street of people who have lately acquired canes which look well in the dusk. He will oblige me by being urbane. A man who carries a borrowed vice is often nearer to a virtue than he supposes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not greatly to my surprise that Lestrade, when I saw him in the course of a day or two, had already taken his walk down Ratcliff Highway and had said, with that particular dryness of his, that if he did not catch Vale he could at least catch the men who dangled from him like ornaments.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A man who carries a cane in his right hand,” said Holmes to me when I reported this, “is not always dangerous. A man who does not carry one, and should, is always to be watched. I have once seen a man’s conscience make him stoop. That is a true danger to the back.”\n",
      "\n",
      "There was one last word from Mr Larch. He asked through his solicitor (a person of such neatness that even Holmes spoke civilly of him) whether I would accept a sum in recognition of “an inadvertent harm.” I sent back an answer which Mrs Hudson afterwards, to my confusion, described as “a doctor’s in a better sense.” I cannot swear I did not phrase the words to please her.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have set down this narrative not because of the danger I passed through, which in truth was small, but because of the way in which a man’s fear of being found out will set him to employ his own hands against himself. Holmes has said, when he is in that mood which I can only call just, that the worst crimes are those which are respectable because the man who commits them nods to a policeman’s child upon the way to church. Mr Larch nods no longer. Whether Esmond Vale, with his metronomic cane, will one day nod to anyone, I do not guess. There are minds like his that are the more dangerous for the civility which covers them. Holmes will encounter him again, I do not doubt. The blue, square bottle upon our table is a reminder which the dust does not gather upon.\n"
