INSTRUCTIONS — REQUIRED
1. Output **only** valid JSON. Do not include any prose, commentary, or markdown outside the JSON.
2. Top-level JSON keys must be exactly: 
   "title", "setting", "crimeDetails", "redHerrings", "investigation", "twist", "resolution".
3. Do not add extra top-level keys.
4. Base all relationships, motives and actions on names and relationships present in <character-details> Use character names exactly as given. 
5. Keep everything period-authentic — no anachronisms; use British English spelling and phrasing.
6. Keep text concise and story-ready (each field should be short, evocative, and directly useful for downstream generation).
7. Make the twist surprising but fair — it must be supported by at least one clue mentioned earlier in `investigation` or `redHerrings`.

FIELD SPECIFICATIONS
- "title": an evocative, 3–7 word title (string). Here are some original sherlock holmes story titles. Take inspiration from the same.
<original-title-examles>
{{ORIGINAL_TITLE_EXAMPLES}}
</original-titles-examles>

- "setting": 1-2 sentences describing the period around which the crime has occurred along with the locations around which the story revolves (e.g: 22B Baker Street, Sussex, etc)
- "crimeDetails": A short pragraph describing the central crime conaining the victim, the means of crime, the motive/hypothesis and initial evidance.
The crime-theme should fall under the following category:
   <crime-theme>
   {{CRIME_THEME}}
   </crime-theme>
- "redHerrings": array of 2–4 short objects, each:
    - "misdirection": brief phrase (what appears suspicious)
    - "why_plausible": 1 sentence explaining why investigators initially believe it
- "investigation": an ordered array of 3–6 investigation steps. Each step is an object:
    - "scene": short scene label (e.g., "Victim's lodging", "Coroner's report")
    - "action": 1 sentence describing what Holmes/Watson or police do
    - "clue_found": 1 short item or observation (must tie to initial_evidence or later twist)
    - "suspects_now": short list of names or descriptors (use names from <character-details> where appropriate)
- "twist": 1–3 concise sentences that reveal the unexpected but logically supported truth. Must cite (mention) at least one earlier clue from "investigation" or "redHerrings".
- "resolution": 2–4 sentences describing how the case is closed, the antagonist's exposure or fate, and immediate fallout for principal characters (use names exactly). Mention any moral or legal consequence and any remaining loose end.

STYLE & LENGTH GUIDELINES
- Use period vocabulary and restrained, precise phrasing.
- Each array item should be short (1–2 sentences each). Fields that expect arrays should be arrays (not comma strings).
- Avoid flowery long paragraphs — aim for clarity and actionable detail for a story generator.

VALIDATION NOTES FOR THE CONSUMER
- If <character-details> marks Sherlock or Watson as victims (via the character generator), adjust who leads investigation accordingly (Holmes may be incapacitated; Watson may narrate), and reflect that in "investigation" and "resolution".
