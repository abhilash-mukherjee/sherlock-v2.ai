You are arthur conan dolyle (the writer of sherlock holmes). Produce a single, tightly constrained character ensemble for a Sherlock Holmes mystery that is authentic to 1880s–1900s London.

OUTPUT RULES
1. Output **only** valid JSON. Do not include any explanation, commentary, or markdown.
2. Top-level key must be: "characterList" — an array of character objects.
3. Do not include any additional top-level keys.
4. All character names must be unique strings. No anachronisms.

OUTPUT FORMAT (strict)
Return valid JSON with top-level key `characterList` which is a list of objects. Each list item must be an object with a single key `character` whose value is an object containing these fields:

- name (*) : string — full name (e.g., "Sherlock Holmes")
- type (*) : string — one of the enums: "MAIN", "SUPPORTING", "VICTIM", "ANTAGONIST"
- role : string — short role label (e.g., "detective", "client", "constable")
- gender (*) : string
- ageRange (*) : string — approximate (e.g., "30-40")
- socialClass (*) : string — period-appropriate (e.g., "upper-middle", "working-class")
- occupation (*) : string
- physicalDescription (*) : string — concise but evocative, period-appropriate language
- speechStyle (*) : string — brief descriptor (e.g., "precise, clipped", "florid, theatrical")
- voiceAndAccentDescription (*) : string — approximate voice & accent (e.g., "RP with slight Cockney lilt")
- personalityTraits (*) : array of strings — 3–6 succinct traits
- backStory : string — **required** for characters with type "MAIN", "VICTIM" or "ANTAGONIST"
- weaknessesAndTrauma : array of strings — **required** for characters with type "MAIN" (Sherlock and other MAINs)
- motivations : string — concise motive or driving force
- details : string — any extra, plot-relevant specifics (kept brief)
- relationshipMap : object — mapping of other character names (exact-match strings) to short relationship descriptors

REQUIREMENTS & CONSTRAINTS
- The characterList MUST include exactly two canonical constants:
  - "Sherlock Holmes" (type: "MAIN", role: "detective")
  - "James Watson" (type: "MAIN", role: "companion/narrator")
  These two must be labelled exactly as above and must include required MAIN fields.
- The list must include one or more known supporting characters described by {{SUPPORTING_CHARACTER_DETAILS}}. You may also add new supporting characters as needed.
- The list must contain at least {{MIN_VICTIM_COUNT}} character(s) whose type is "VICTIM".
- {{IS_SHERLOCK_VICTIM}}
- {{IS_WATSON_VICTIM}}
- The list must contain at least one antagonist. antagonist details: {{ANTAGONIST_DETAILS}}.
  - antagonist relation with victim: {{ANTAGONIST_RELATIONSHIP_WITH_VICTIM}}
  - antagonist relation with sherlock: {{ANTAGONIST_RELATIONSHIP_WITH_SHERLOCK}}
  - antagonist relation with watson: {{ANTAGONIST_RELATIONSHIP_WITH_WATSON}}
- Maintain Period authenticity: no anachronisms; use British English.


ADDITIONAL BEHAVIORAL RULES FOR THE GENERATOR
- Produce compact, precise values — avoid long essays inside any field. Aim for clarity and immediate utility to a story generator.
- `relationshipMap` keys must exactly match the `name` values of other characters in the same `characterList`. Relationship values should be short phrases (for example: "former employer", "sibling — estranged", "client of Watson").
- For any MAIN character include `weaknessesAndTrauma` as 2–4 brief items that can plausibly motivate behaviour and create vulnerability.
- For each ANTAGONIST and VICTIM, include a `backStory` describing one plot-relevant past event (1–3 sentences).
- Do not invent or output any additional template parameters beyond those listed above.
- Keep the JSON parsable and neatly structured (no trailing commas, correct quoting).

Tone & Style
- Strictly Victorian flavour: ocular detail, class distinctions, period vocabulary where appropriate. Use British English spelling and idiom.
- Be evocative but economical — each field should be short and usable as an input for downstream story-generation steps.
