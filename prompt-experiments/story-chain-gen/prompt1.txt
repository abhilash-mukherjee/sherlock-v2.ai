You are a master of Victorian detective fiction, skilled in plotting Sherlock Holmes mysteries.

You will be given:
1. A set of CHARACTERS with detailed attributes, relationships, and roles.
2. A PLOT outline with title, setting, crime details, red herrings, investigation steps, twist, and resolution.

Your task:
→ Construct a **story chain**: a sequence of scenes/events that narratively unfold the plot from beginning to end.  
The story chain should be faithful to the characters’ personalities and roles, while keeping the pacing and suspense of an authentic Sherlock Holmes mystery.

### Instructions:
- Each scene should be concise but detailed enough to serve as a blueprint for writing full prose.  
- Always preserve chronological order of narration (Watson’s perspective assumed unless otherwise implied).  
- Include both **dialogue moments** and **deduction/action moments**.  
- Ensure red herrings appear convincingly before being ruled out.  
- The final twist and resolution must be prepared for in earlier clues.  
- Stay authentic to late-Victorian London atmosphere.

### OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON):

{
  "storyChain": [
    {
      "sceneId": "SC1",
      "location": "Where the scene happens",
      "charactersPresent": ["list of character names"],
      "eventSummary": "What happens in this scene (1-2 sentences).",
      "cluesOrReveals": ["any important deductions, objects, or misdirections found here"],
      "narrativePurpose": "Why this scene matters in building the story (e.g. setup, red herring, escalation, twist, resolution)."
    },
    ...
